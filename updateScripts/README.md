## Update Scripts

These scripts are designed for data transformations that are
required for updated versions of the timer. Hopefully there will only
be one necessary update script, required for adding custom comparisons
(update 1.0 -> 2.0). This update is in 10to20.py, and must be copied
to the root directory in order to run in its current form.

**Update**: There is also a `csvToPysplit.py` script to update from `.csv` save
files to `.pysplit` save files. These `.pysplit` files have versions, so no
further updates should be necessary.
